		<h3><a name="newtowp">a. If you are new to WordPress</a></h3>
		<hr/>
		
		<p>Although building a website with WordPress is significantly much easier than coding it by yourself, 
		if you are a beginner, even working with WordPress may be difficult to you. That's why, in this section we will
		provide some useful links and also will explain how to get oriented in the documentation and what pattern to
		follow when building your website with our theme.<br/>
		Please note that this documentation covers all the main settings for the theme, but it doesn't cover
		instructions about working with WordPress, as this is a very extensive topic. If you are new
		to WordPress, we would recommend to first get familiar with the WordPress system, so you can have
		at least basic knowledge about how it works and then proceed with setting the theme.</p><br/>
		
		<b><u>Working with WordPress - Useful Links</u></b><br />
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">The WordPress Codex</a> - the official WordPress manual containing lots of information and tutorials about working with WordPress.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.wp101.com/tutorials/">WP101 Basics Training</a> - the perfect beginning spot for those just getting started with WordPress. 
		The video tutorials provided are very helpful to easily understand how WordPress works.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br />

		
		
		<h3><a name="working-theme">b. Working with the theme</a></h3>
<hr/>
		<p>Once you have some basic WordPress knowledge, you are ready to go with setting the theme. Here are some example steps about how you can do this: </p>
		<ol>
		<li>Install and activate the theme - read about how to do this in the <a href="#activate">Installing and activating the theme</a> section.<br />
		Having problems with installing the theme? <br />
		&raquo; Refer to the "Fail to install the theme" subsection of the <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section.
		</li>
		<li>Change your logo - learn how to do this in the  <a href="#change_logo">Changing the logo</a> section</li>
		<li>Create your basic menu - during the process of setting your theme, you will be changing your menu links all the time. However, it is
		good to start with having the main menu set. Learn how to set your menu in the  <a href="#menu">Setting the menu</a> section.</li>
		<li>Start with creating your content
		<p>You can create all the content by creating your pages one by one. Here are some examples of what steps to
		follow when creating different pages:</p>

		
		
		<b>If you need a full-width custom home page:</b>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to <a href="#template">Template pages</a> &raquo; <a href="#custom_page">Home Page - Full-width custom page template</a> section to learn how
		to create the page and how to add elements to it.</li>
		<li>You need to set a slider for that page? &raquo; Go to the <a href="#sliders">Sliders</a> section to read how
			to create a slider. After you have your slider created and populated with images, you have to select the slider you have created for the page (how to set the slider is explained in both the slider's section and the full-width custom page template section)</li>
		</ol>

		
		<b>If you need a Blog page:</b>
		<ol>
		<li>Go to <a href="#template">Template pages</a> &raquo; <a href="#index">Blog page</a> section to learn how
		to create a blog page, how to create posts to it and all the settings you can do for this page</li>
		<li>You need to set a slider for the blog? &raquo; Go to the <a href="#sliders">Sliders</a> section to read how
			to create a slider. After you have your slider created and populated with images, you have to select the slider you have created for the page (how to set the slider is explained in both the slider's section and the blog page section)</li>
		<li>You need a separate blog sidebar? &raquo; Go to the <a href="#sidebar">The sidebars</a> section to learn how
		to create additional sidebars and how to add widgets to them. After you have created your sidebar, go back to the
		<a href="#index">Blog page</a> section to learn how to set the sidebar you have created to your blog page.
		</li>
		</ol>

		<br />
		<p>Basically, these are the steps you have to follow - when you need to create a page, just go to its corresponding subsection
		of the <a href="#template">Template pages</a> section and read about how to create it and what settings you can do for the page.
		The main key about understanding how the theme works is to read the documentation we have provided carefully, as we
		have explained everything you need to know about the theme in here.</p>
		
		</li>
		<li>Once you follow all these steps and have the basic theme setup, you can also check the rest of the sections
		of this documentation to read more about the other features that our theme provides.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<p>We hope you will enjoy working with the theme!</p>

	  <h2><a name="activate">2. Installing and activating the theme</a></h2>
		<hr />
		
		
		<p>There are 2 main ways to upload the theme:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Via the built in WordPress theme uploader</b>
		<p>You can read the instructions about installing a theme via the WordPress uploader below, but you can also
		watch the "<i>Installing a Pexeto Theme via WordPress Uploader</i>" video <a href="http://pexetothemes.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-a-pexeto-theme/">here</a></p>
		<p>First you have to unzip the download file and find the zip file called <b>porcelain.zip</b>.
		After this you have to go in the admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Themes, click on the
		<b>Install Themes tab</b> and then click on the "Upload" tab (located in the top section of the page). After you click the "Upload" tab, a new page
		will be opened where you will be asked to find the .zip file on your local
		file system. </p>
		<div class="note_box"><b>Note:</b> Some servers have limited folder access settings applied and wouldn't allow uploading the theme trough the
		admin - in these case you have to upload the theme via FTP.</div>
		</li>
		<li><b>Via FTP client</b>
		<p>You can read the instructions about installing a theme via FTP below, but you can also
		watch the "<i>Installing a Pexeto Theme via FTP</i>" video <a href="http://pexetothemes.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-a-pexeto-theme/">here</a></p>
		<p>If you know the FTP login details of the server where your site is hosted and you have a
		FTP client installed (such as FileZilla), you might consider using this way of uploading your theme. First you have to
		unzip the download file, find the zip file called <b>porcelain.zip</b>, unzip it and upload the folder to the 
		main WordPress installation folder &raquo; wp-content &raquo; themes. Please note that if you 
		prefer this way of installation, you have to make sure that the main files of the theme are contained
		just within one folder of the <b>themes</b> folder. The right way to locate your root theme files is
		for example <b>themes/porcelain</b> but not <b>themes/porcelain/porcelain</b>.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can activate the theme after it is uploaded on the server.
		 In order to activate this theme you have to go to the admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Themes. In this section you should
  see the theme with a title <b>Porcelain by Pexeto</b>. Just click on the <b>Activate</b> button and your theme should get activated.
   </p>

        	these settings won't be applied globally to the theme. This settings section is

  	<p>In order to set a thumbnail (featured image) to a post/page, when creating/editing your post/page in the bottom of the right sidebar
  you will see a link "Set a Featured Image":<br/>
  <img src="images/set_thumbnail.jpg" width="280" /><br/>

		<hr />
      
    <img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="" width="160"/><br />
  
        <p> To change the logo image, you can either use your own existing logo image or edit the included logo PSD file - it is called <b>logo.psd</b> and is located within the PSD folder.
    </p>
 
  <p>After you have your logo image, you have to go to the Porcelain Options &raquo; <b>General Settings &raquo; Main &raquo; Logo</b> 
  and upload (or insert the image URL) in the <b>Logo Image</b> section. If you would like to have
  a sharp logo image on retina displays, the image uploaded should be twice bigger than its
  display size - for example if the standard logo image size is 30x70 pixels, the image size of the
  uploaded image should be 60x140 pixels. <br/>

  The default logo image width is 133 pixels and the height depends on the 
original image ratio. If you would like to apply custom width or height to the
logo image, you can do this in the "Custom logo width" and "Custom logo height" fields.</p>

<h3><a name="menu">b. Setting the menu</a></h3>
		<hr />

		<img src="images/menu.jpg" width="300" alt="" /><br />

		<p>When you fisrt install the theme, the menu will contain all the pages created and
		it sets drop-downs when there is a parent/child hierarchy created within the pages.
		However, we would recommend building your custom menu by using the WordPress
		Custom Menus functionality, as it is more flexible and very easy to work with.
		To learn how to create a WordPress Custom Menu, you can follow the instructions below.</p>


 
         <p>Here are the steps you have to follow in order to set the menu:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>Go to Appearance &raquo; Menus. To create the menu click on the
         	"Create a new menu" link.

         <br/>
         <img src="images/custom_menu.jpg" width="400" />
         </li>

<h3><a name="header_style">e. Changing the default background color and image</a></h3><hr />
<p>You can set a custom background image and background color to the header section:</p>

<img src="images/header_img.jpg" width="600" alt="">

<p>There are two ways to apply these settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Globally for all the pages</b> - the color you set in the
	<b>Porcelain Options &raquo; Style Settings &raquo; Accent Color</b> fields will be
	set as a header color for all the pages. You can also set a background image for
all the pages in the <b>Porcelain Options &raquo; Style Settings &raquo; Header background image</b>
field.</li>
	<li><b>Custom for each page</b> - you can apply a custom background color and background image
		for each page in the <b>Header Background</b> field of the settings section of the page:<br/>
	<img src="images/header_bg.jpg" width="700" alt="">
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also apply an overlay background to the header section to improve the
readability and visibility of the menu links and the other elements, especially
when using light images.</p>
<img src="images/header_bg_overlay.jpg" width="600" alt="">
<p>You can enable this overlay background in the <b>Porcelain Options &raquo; Style Settings &raquo; Set a dark transparent background to the top header</b> field.</p>



<br/>  
<h3><a name="sticky_header">f. Setting a sticky header</a></h3><hr />

	<p>The sticky header is enabled by default, you can enable/disable it in the
	 <b>Porcelain Options &raquo; General Settings &raquo; Main &raquo; "Sticky Header"</b> field. When enabled the header will be always displayed in the top section
		of the window, even after the user scrolls down the page.</p>


    <br/>    


<br/>  
<h3><a name="header_title">g. Showing/hiding the page title</a></h3><hr />

<p>The page title is always displayed by default</p>

<img src="images/header_title.jpg" width="600" alt=""><br/><br/>

There are two ways to set whether to show it or not:
<ul>
	<li><b>Globally</b> for all the pages you can select whether to show the pages
		title in the <b>Porcelain Options &raquo; Post &amp; Page Settings &raquo;
		Pages &raquo; Display page title</b> field.</li>
	<li><b>For each page</b> in the <b>Display Page Title</b> <a href="#custom">custom field</a>
		of the page. By default this field is set to apply the globally selected option,

		<b><u>Creating the portfolio/gallery items (adding images to the gallery)</u></b>
		<br /><img src="images/portfolio_item.jpg" width="250" alt="" /><br />
		Each of the images in the gallery represents a single Portfolio Item. For each of the portfolio items:
		<ol>
		<li><b>Creating new items</b><br/>
			You can create a new item in <b>"Portfolio" &raquo; Add New</b> section. You can set the title in the "Title" field of the item.</li>

			</p>
			<p>As the images uploaded would be bigger, the thumbnail image will be resized automatically to the size in which it should be displayed. However, if you prefer to use your custom thumbnail image,
				you can set it in the "Custom Thumbnail URL" field of the item.</p>
			
		</li>

				second item's image will be displayed, you can enable the
				"Make lightbox items preview images related to each other" option

		 <b><u>Changing the accent color:</u></b>
		<p>The accent color is the primary theme elements color, which is applied 
			as background or text color to different elements, such as the main
			title area of the page, hover on images and links, some titles, etc.
			We have added several predefined color options in the "Predefined Accent Color"
			section, but you can also pick a custom color in the "Custom Accent Color" section.</p>
		
		<br/>
		 <b><u>Other style options</u></b>
		<p>The "General" tab of the Styles section contains some general style settings,
			such as the main accent color, body background and general header style settings.
			You can also apply custom styles and colors to the rest of the elements in the 
			"Content" and "Footer" tabs of the Styles section.
			You can also read more about how to set the fonts in the
			<a href="#fonts">Fonts</a> section.</p>
<br/>

	 <b><u>Additional Styles Section</u></b>
		<p>If you would like  to make CSS modifications to the theme's style,
			you can insert the additional CSS changes into the the Porcelain Options &raquo; 
			Style Settings &raquo; Additional Styles. It is recommended not to edit the
			style.css file, as this file will be reset to default once you update the theme
			and you will loose your CSS modifications. Another option to safely make
			CSS modifications is by creating a WordPress child theme. You can read
			more about creating child themes <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">here</a>.</p>

		<a name="fonts" ><h2>11. Fonts<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>

		<p>By default the theme uses the "Open Sans" (for the body text) and "Oswald" (for the headings) Google fonts.</p>
		
		<p>All the fonts settings can be applied in the Porcelain Options &raquo; Style settings &raquo; Fonts section.</p>


		<p>This section provides an option to change the fonts for the main
			body font, headings and menu:</p>
			<img src="images/change_fonts.jpg" alt="" width="400">
		<p>By default you can select between the standard web-safe fonts in the 
			font options. However, you can also add custom Google fonts.</p>
		
		
		<b><u>Adding Google fonts</u></b><br />
		<p>You can browse the Google Fonts library <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">here</a> </p>
		<p>In order to use Google Fonts, the field "Enable Google Fonts" should be set to "ON".  
		You can add additional fonts in the "Add Google Font" section.
		</p>
		<p>In the <b>Font Name / Font Family</b> you have to either insert the font name of the font
			or a font family.</p>
		<p>In the <b>Font URL</b> field you have to insert the URL of the font file.</p>
<br/>
		<p><b>EXAMPLE</b></p>
		If you would like to use the <b>Nobile</b> font, click on the "Quick Use" button.<br/>
		<img src="images/quick_use.jpg" alt="" width="250">
 
		<p>In the <b>Font Name / Font Family</b> field you have to insert the font family
			that Google Provides, in this case:<br/>
		<b>'Nobile', sans-serif</b><br/>
		<img src="images/font_family.jpg" alt="" width="250">
		</p>

		<p>In the <b>Font URL</b> you have to insert the font file URL only

		<a name="translation" ><h2>12. Translation<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />	
	

	<p>This theme is ready for translation - it comes with a .po file that contains
		all the embedded into the theme strings. The translation process consists of two
		main steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Generating .mo files that contain the theme's translated strings</li>
			<li>Configuring your language locale</li>
		</ul>
<br/><br/>
	<hr>
	<h3><a name="create_mo">a. Creating a mo file with the translated strings</a></h3>
	<hr>

	<p> There is a file called <b>default.po</b> located in the <b>lang</b> folder within the main theme folder. You have to open this
   file with a program that can generate .mo files, such as <a href="http://www.poedit.net/download.php">PoEdit</a>.
   Once you open it, you can insert the words in the additional language. Here is an example, with the file
   opened with PoEdit and the meanings of the words inserted into English:</p>
   
    <img src="images/trans.jpg" width="450" /><br />
   
   <p>
   In the same way you can insert the translations in the additional language. Once you save the document, a .mo file
   will be generated in the directory you specify. You have to rename this .mo file to the locale of the language used.
   For example, if this language is French, the name of the file should be fr_FR.mo. You can
   check a list with more language locales here: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language</a><br/>
   After that, you have to insert this .mo file in the <b>lang</b> folder of the theme.
	Please note that if you save the .mo file within the <b>lang</b> folder of the theme,
	the lang folder will be reset when you install a theme update and that's why it is recommended
	to set the .mo files within a child theme: </p>

   		<p><b>Setting the .mo files within a child theme</b><br/>
		If you have a child theme activated for the theme, it is recommended to
		save the .mo files within the child theme, as they will remain saved even after a 
		theme update which replaces all the theme files. To do this you have to:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a "lang" folder in your child theme folder and save the .mo
				files in that folder</li>
			<li>Go to <b>Porcelain Options</b> &raquo; 
			<b>General Settings</b> &raquo; <b>Main</b> and select the "Child Theme Folder"
			option in the "Load translation files from" field.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can read more about child themes <a href="#child_theme">here</a></p>

	<p><b>If you would like to change some of the theme strings, but still your default language
   	to be U.S. English</b>, you have to follow the steps above and name the generated .mo file
   	<b>en_US.mo</b> </p>

<br/><br/>
	<hr>
	<h3><a name="set_locale">b. Configuring your language locale</a></h3>
	<hr>

	<ul>
		<li><p><b>If you would like to use the WordPress installation in one language only</b>, 
			other than U.S. English and you are not using any additional language plugins, 
			you can set the language locale in the <b>Porcelain Options</b> &raquo; 
			<b>General Settings</b> &raquo; <b>Main</b> &raquo; <b>Default locale</b> field.
			
			 You can
   check a list with more language locales here: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language</a><br/>
		</p>
		<p>If you use additional language plugins, such as WPML you have to leave this field
			empty, as the plugin will be the one to configure the locale based on its options.</p>


	</li>
		<li><p><b>If you would like to use the WordPress installation in multiple languages</b>,
			the easiest way to accomplish this would be to use a multilingual plugin, such
			as <a href="http://wpml.org/">WPML</a>. Multilingual plugins add options to
			translate all the content into multiple languages and will also take care of
			setting the locale and loading the correct text translation.</p>
			<p>If for example, you have two additional languages, such as German and French,
				you just have to follow the instructions above and generate a .mo file
				for each language - that would be de_DE.mo and fr_FR.mo respectively.</p></li>

		<p>This theme uses the <a href="https://github.com/sy4mil/Aqua-Resizer/">Aqua Resizer</a>

			you install a standard theme - you can follow the instructions <a href="#activate">here</a></p>
		<p>After you install the theme you can add custom CSS snippets in the style.css file of the child theme,
			custom PHP code in the functions.php file, add the theme translation files in the <b>lang</b>
			folder of the child theme and create other files to overwrite
			the current templates - you can read more about using child themes in the
			official WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">Child Themes</a> guide.</p>

		<p>All the main PHP functions in the theme are set to be overwritable, so if you would like to 
			modify the way a function works, you can just redeclare it. For example if you would like to
			change the defaul <b>pexeto_wp_title</b> function that displays the title of the document:</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
if(!function_exists('pexeto_wp_title')){
	function pexeto_wp_title( $title, $sep ) {
		//theme code goes here
	}
}
</pre>

<p>You can just overwrite it in the functions.php file of the child theme like this:</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
function pexeto_wp_title($title, $sep){
	//custom code goes here
}
</pre>

<p>In this way, you can overwrite every theme function that is wrapped with the function_exisis check:</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">
if(!function_exists('function_name')){
	//function code
}
</pre>

		<p>In this section you can check the most common issues and the solutions for them</p>
		
		
		
		<ol>
		
		<li><b>Fail to install the theme</b>
		<p>If you experience any problems with installing the theme, please check the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Please make sure you have installed the theme as described in the <a href="#activate">Activating the theme</a> section</li>
		<li>If you have used the WordPress uploader and can't upload the theme: as the theme is versatile
		and provides lots of options, its zip file is bigger than standard themes and some servers
		can't handle an upload with that file size. In this case you have to use an FTP client to upload the theme.
		</li>
		<li>If you have used an FTP client to upload the theme:<br />
		* make sure the theme main files (such as style.css and index.php) file are located just within one directory
		apart the wp-themes directory. The right way to locate your root theme files is
		for example <b>themes/porcelain</b> but not <b>themes/porcelain/porcelain</b><br />
		* the problem you are experiencing may be related with the FTP client used - in this case you can try with another one-
		we recommend <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">FileZilla</a> FTP client.
		</li>
		<li>Make sure you have WordPress 3.5 or higher installed</li>
		<li>Make sure your server is running PHP version 5 or higher. Although when developing the theme, we have followed
		the main rules for cross-version compatibility, we have the possibility to test the theme on servers running
		versions higher than 5.0. If your server runs an old PHP version and you get any errors when installing the theme, you
		can contact the hosting support and ask them update PHP to a newer version.</li>

		<h3><a name="install-update">a. Installing an update</a></h3>
<hr/>
			<p>You can install an update of the theme either automatically by using the built in the theme automatic update functionality or manually.</p>

		<b><u>Installing the update automatically</u></b>
		<div class="error_box">
		 <b>Important: </b>Please note that with the automatic theme update any code modifications done in the theme's code will be lost, so please make sure you have a backup copy of the theme files before you update the theme. 
		</div>
		
		<div class="error_box">
		<b>Important:</b> The folder that contains the theme files must be called "Porcelain" in order to automatically update the theme.
		</div>
		<p>In order to use the automatic update functionality of the theme, first you have to go to <b>Porcelain Options -> General -> Theme Update</b> section and insert your Envato Marketplace Username and Envato Marketplace API Key. The Envato Marketplace Username field should contain the username of the account you have used to purchase the theme on ThemeForest. <br/>
		To obtain your API Key, you have to visit your "My Settings" page on any of the Envato Marketplaces (ThemeForest). You can get the
		API Key in the "API Keys" section of the "My Settings" page.</p>
		<p>When a new update is released you should see a new menu item in Dashboard called "Porcelain - New Updates". Please note that it may take several hours after the update is released to have it displayed, as the cache is refreshed periodically on several hours.
		When you open the "Porcelain - New Updates" page you have to click on the "Automatically Update Theme" button and the theme will be automatically updated for you.
		</p>
		
		<b><u>Installing an update manually </u></b>
<p>There are two main ways of installing an update manually:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>By uploading the theme as a new theme (recommended)</i>- this is an easier way to accomplish this.<br/>
	First you have to either delete your current theme or rename its folder on the server.
	To rename the theme you have to log in via FTP to the server, navigate to the WordPress installation folder &raquo; wp-content &raquo; themes folder where you will find the theme folder that you can rename.
	After this you just have to upload
the updated theme zip file via the built in WordPress theme uploader as a new theme as explained <a href="#activate">here</a>
and activate the theme. 

<div class="note_box">
		 <b>Note: </b>Please note that with the activating of the new theme it is possible your menu setting not to
		 be saved for the new theme. If so, you just have to go to Appearance &raquo; Menus &raquo; Theme Locations, select the menu (it will be
		 still there) and press the "Save" button.
		</div>
<p>Once you install the updated theme and make sure that everything is working normally, you can go back to the Themes
section and delete the older version of the theme.</p>
</li>
<li><i>Via FTP</i> - you can use an FTP client (such as FileZilla) and replace all the theme files with the
updated ones. The theme folder is located in the WordPress installation folder &raquo; wp-content &raquo; themes folder
of the server.

<div class="error_box">
		 <b>Note: </b>Please note that with the file replacing all the code changes you have made to the files 
		 (if you have made any) will be lost, so please
		 make sure you have a backup copy of the theme files before you do the replacement. All the settings that
		 you have made from the admin panel won't be lost- they will be still available.
		</div>
		</li>

	<h3><a name="v131">g. Version 1.3.1</a></h3><hr />	
	<p>This update includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Security update to fix issues related with the recently found XSS <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/">vulnerability of the add_query_arg()</a> function - updated the TGM Plugin Activation class
		</li>
		
	</ul>

	<h3><a name="v132">h. Version 1.3.2</a></h3><hr />	
	<p>This update includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Security fix: Updated the PrettyPhoto lightbox plugin to version 3.1.6 to fix a recently found XSS vulnerability</li>
	</ul>

	<h3><a name="v133">i. Version 1.3.3</a></h3><hr />	
	<p>This update includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Handle the WordPress 4.3 update <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/"> terms splitting</a>.<br/> The upcoming WordPress 4.3 will automatically split all of the shared terms between different taxonomies, which means that it will change the IDs of those terms in the database. This can affect the theme’s elements that store references to the terms IDs, such as some elements (like sliders or services boxes) can lose their default order or when added to a page, they can load items from other elements from the same type. 
If you have this theme update installed prior to updating to WordPress 4.3, when a term splitting occurs, the theme will change all of the references from the old IDs to the new IDs and will prevent those issues.<br/>
			<b>Important: Please make sure to update the theme before updating WordPress to 4.3 once it is released, as the terms splitting will be performed during the WordPress upgrade process.</b></li>
			<li>Fixed: a minor design issue in the admin with the <a href="https://usersinsights.com/">Users Insights WordPress plugin</a></li>
			<li>General code improvements</li>
